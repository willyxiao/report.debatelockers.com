This was my first coding project! I created it as a final project for the introduction to computer science class at Harvard.
It's a database that keeps track of information about each round at Policy Debate Tournaments. It allows users to register for texts and emails at the end of each round, and users can download the reports and save them on a local computer.
Enjoy checking out the code!
