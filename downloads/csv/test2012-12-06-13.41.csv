Hammond: how do we get republicans on board, the ev that the neg reads says payroll taxes/infrastructure bank. Democrats gave them cover for the job blockage rather than give them power for future blockage. Most of the impact calculus wasn’t in the 1ar. 
They went for Obama won’t take action?
What did the 1ar need to answer?
Dana Randall: large risk of the disad, they have infrastructure pass and a payroll impact, your uniqueness evidence is about jobs. Our uniqueness evidence isn’t responsive to this. Elections thumper wasn’t in the 2ar – that would’ve been a good uniqueness argument. 
To Robel: need doesn’t solve econ, also need to do quick author extensions. 
Sam Shore: DA messes in a game-changer kind of way and it’s jacked, so you can’t win a larger risk of the advantage as they’re winning the DA. They read two specific disads and you’re caught in the 1nc tangle w/o getting into the payroll tax and infrastructure bank debate. "
